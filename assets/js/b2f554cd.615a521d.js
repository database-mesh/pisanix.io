The newly released one supports dynamic read/write splitting. More details below.\\n\\n## Introducing dynamic read/write splitting\\n### Introduction\\n\\nRead/write splitting is one of the most commonly used solutions for MySQL\'s high availability. It improves query performance and reduces server load in practical scenarios. On top of the static rules of v0.1.1, dynamic read/write splitting is added in this release.\\n\\nRead/write splitting rules need to be configured when it comes to splitting with dynamic awareness. Pisa-Proxy performs SQL routing according to the rules. As shown in Figure 1.1, the Pisa-Proxy backend will start four monitors to sense the backend cluster status. \\n\\nMonitor Reconcile will calculate and aggregate the data reported by the Monitor and draw the final state of the backend cluster. Then Monitor Reconcile sends the state information to RulesMatch through the channel. RulesMatch dynamically adjusts the backend data source list once it receives the message.\\n\\nThe concepts included above are: \\n\\n- Node: Backend database node.\\n- RulesMatch: RulesMatch engine matches with the SQL query statements received by Pisa-Proxy based on the written rule set. \\n- TargetRole: A TargetRole group matched by the RulesMatch engine. Each TargetRole group may contain one or more nodes.\\n- LoadBalance: The load balance module selects an appropriate node from the TargetRole group according to the corresponding algorithm.\\n- TargetInstance: Nodes selected by the LoadBalance module.\\n- Discovery: Discovery type, which corresponds to the high availability strategy used by the backend data source, such as MHA, RDS, MGR, etc. The newly released version mainly supports MHA.\\n- Monitor: It refers to the backend detector module of Pisa-Proxy, which mainly relies on four kinds of Monitors in MHA.\\n  - Connect Monitor: detect database connectivity.\\n  - Ping Monitor: detect whether the database is healthy.\\n  - Replication Lag Monitor: detect the latency status of primary-secondary replication. \\n  - Read Only Monitor: detect the roles of primary-secondary databases.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/release-v020-1.png\\" width=\\"600\\" length=\\"600\\"/>\\n\\n### Read/write splitting configuration\\n\\nThe configuration mode of dynamic read/write splitting is the same as that of the static one. The configuration items of dynamic read/write splitting are as follows: \\n\\n|Parameter|\\tType|\\tDependency or not|\\tDefault Value|\\tDescription|\\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\\n|user|\\tstring|\\tYes|\\tNone|\\tDetector module checks the username of SQL statements.|\\n|password|\\tstring|\\tYes|\\tNone|\\tDetector module checks the password of SQL statements.|\\n|monitor_period|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t1000|\\tThe period (ms) by which detector module updates and senses the backend data source status.|\\n|connect_period|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t1000|\\tConnect Monitor detection period (ms)|\\n|connect_timeout|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t6000|\\tConnect Monitor detection timeout (ms)|\\n|connect_failure_threshold|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t1|\\tNumber of retries when Connect Monitor detection fails|\\n|ping_period|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t1000|\\tPing Monitor detection period (ms)|\\n|ping_timeout|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t6000|\\tPing Monitor detection timeout (ms)|\\n|ping_failure_threshold|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t1|\\tNumber of retries when Ping Monitor detection fails.|\\n|replication_lag_period|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t1000|\\tReplication Lag Monitor detection period (ms)|\\n|replication_lag_timeout|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t6000|\\tReplication Lag Monitor detection timeout (ms)|\\n|replication_lag_failure_threshold|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t1|\\tNumber of retries when Replication Lag Monitor detection fails.|\\n|max_replication_lag|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t10000|\\tUser-defined maximum primary/secondary latency threshold (ms)|\\n|read_only_period|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t1000|\\tRead Only detection period (ms)|\\n|read_only_timeout|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t6000|\\tRead Only detection timeout (ms)|\\n|read_only_failure_threshold|\\tu64|\\tYes|\\t3|\\tNumber of retries when Read Only Monitor detection fails.|\\n\\nCRD configuration sample:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: core.database-mesh.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: TrafficStrategy\\nmetadata:\\n  name: catalogue\\n  namespace: demotest\\nspec:\\n  selector:\\n    matchLabels:\\n      source: test\\n  loadBalance:\\n    readWriteSplitting:\\n      dynamic:\\n        defaultTarget: readwrite\\n        discovery:\\n          masterHighAvailability:\\n            connectionProbe:\\n              failureThreshold: 3\\n              periodMilliseconds: 1000\\n              timeoutMilliseconds: 6000\\n            monitorPeriod: 1000\\n            pingProbe:\\n              failureThreshold: 3\\n              periodMilliseconds: 1000\\n              timeoutMilliseconds: 6000\\n            readOnlyProbe:\\n              failureThreshold: 3\\n              periodMilliseconds: 1000\\n              timeoutMilliseconds: 6000\\n            replicationLagProbe:\\n              failureThreshold: 3\\n              maxReplicationLag: 3\\n              periodMilliseconds: 1000\\n              timeoutMilliseconds: 6000\\n            user: monitor\\n            password: monitor\\n        rules:\\n        - algorithmName: roundrobin\\n          name: write-rule\\n          regex:\\n          - ^insert\\n          target: readwrite\\n          type: regex\\n        - algorithmName: roundrobin\\n          name: read-rule\\n          regex:\\n          - ^select\\n          target: read\\n          type: regex\\n```\\n\\n## Pisanix v0.2.0 Description \\n\\n### New features\\n- Pisa-Controller\\n  - Support dynamic read/write splitting in the TrafficStrategy CRD ReadWriteSplitting field #208\\n- Pisa-Proxy\\n  - Support dynamic read/write splitting #204\\n  - Add the sub-command: daemonsidecar #190\\n\\n### Enhancements\\n- Refactor config files of Pisa-Proxy #182\\n- Complete the SHOW SQL statement parsing #183\\n- Add code coverage checks to Pisa-Controller #192\\n- Enable reconnecting when backend data source fails to be connected #215\\n\\n### Improvements\\n- Pisa-Controller\\n  - Fix webhook tls #221\\n- Pisa-Proxy\\n  - Fix the request failure to switch MySQL authentication #170\\n  - Handle exceptions of EOF package of MySQL protocol #166\\n  - Fix the Charset character set #154\\n  - Fix the environment variables injection #223\\n\\n### Others\\n- Docs\\n  - New read/write splitting manual: https://www.pisanix.io/docs/v0.2.0/Features/readwritesplitting/\\n  - Updated standalone deployment manual\uff1ahttps://www.pisanix.io/docs/v0.2.0/UseCases/standalone\\n- Charts\\n  - Updated to v0.2.0\\n\\nThere are 62 PRs in this release.

In actual scenarios, it can improve query performance and reduce server load. The general structure is as follows:\\n\\nRead-write splitting is  part of the traffic strategies in Pisa-Proxy.\\n\\nCurrently, Pisa-Proxy supports two kinds of read-write splitting solutions:\\n- Static read-write splitting: no backend awareness of database role change.\\n- Dynamic read-write splitting (coming): backend awareness of the primary and secondary databases change.\\n\\nCurrently, both solutions require the configuration of read-write splitting rules. The read-write splitting rule refers to that Pisa-Proxy needs to match the SQL statement queried with the configured rule. If the match succeeds, the SQL statement is routed to the corresponding node according to the rule. If the match fails, the SQL statement is routed to the configured default node.\\n\\nThere are several concepts included\uff1a\\n\\n- Node: the backend database node.\\n- RulesMatch: The RulesMatch engine matches the SQL query statements received by Pisa-Proxy by the compiled rule set.\\n- TargetRole: The TargetRole group matched by the rule matching engine. Each TargetRole group may contain one or more nodes.\\n- LoadBalance: The load balancer module will select an appropriate node from the TargetRole group according to corresponding algorithms.\\n- TargetInstance: nodes selected from the LoadBalance module.\\n\\n\\nThe implementation logic is as follows: \\n\\n### Read-Write Splitting Configuration \\n\\n|Property|Value Type|Dependency or not|Default Value|Implication|\\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\\n|static|object|No|No|Static R/W splitting type|\\n|dynamic|object|No|No|Dynamic R/W splitting configuration|\\n\\n#### Static read-write splitting configuration\\n\\n|Property|Value Type|Dependency or not|Default Value|Implication|\\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\\n|defaultTarget|enum|No|No|The target group of default routing|\\n|rules|array{rule}|Yes|No|Read-write splitting rule|\\n\\n#### Read-Write Splitting Rule Description\\n\\nCurrently, read-write splitting rules can only be matched through RegEx.

And this is a example of Weaveworks [Socks-shop](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo). \\n\\n### VirtualDatabase\\nVirtualDatabase is the root concept for every database governance actions in Pisanix. To developers, VirtualDatabase is represented as a database endpoint. For DBAs, VirtualDatabase is some kind of a logical database, so they need to provide some traffic strategy and bind it to a real backend database endpoint.\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: core.database-mesh.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: VirtualDatabase\\nmetadata:\\n  name: catalogue\\n  namespace: default\\nspec:\\n  services:\\n  - databaseMySQL:               # Declare a MySQL database \\n      db: socksdb                # Declare the schema \\n      host: 127.0.0.1            \\n      port: 3306                 \\n      user: catalogue_user       \\n      password: default_password \\n    name: mysql                  \\n    trafficStrategy: catalogue   # The target traffic strategy for the database \\n```\\n\\n\\n### TrafficStrategy\\n\\nTrafficStrategy defines how the SQL requests will be routed to the real database endpoint, strategies like loadbalance, concurrency control, circuit break are supported now.\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: core.database-mesh.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: TrafficStrategy\\nmetadata:\\n  name: catalogue\\n  namespace: default\\nspec:\\n  loadBalance:                   \\n    simpleLoadBalance:           # A simple load balance strategy\\n      kind: random               # support random as selection algorithm \\n  selector:\\n    matchLabels:                 # Declare the label selector to choose the backend database\\n      source: catalogue\\n```\\n\\n### DatabaseEndpoint\\n\\nDatabase Endpoint refers to a real database endpoint, no matter it\'s endpoint of AWS RDS, a MySQL instance, or ShardingSphere. Virtual Database consumes several DatabaseEndpoint with TrafficStrategy.\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: core.database-mesh.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: DatabaseEndpoint\\nmetadata:\\n  name: catalogue-db\\n  namespace: default\\nspec:\\n  database:\\n    MySQL:                        # Declare the database type MySQL \\n      db: socksdb                 \\n      host: cataloguedb.codtynlacssn.rds.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn\\n      port: 3306                  \\n      user: root                  \\n      password: fake_password    \\n```\\n\\nNow the working flow is like :\\n1. Developers submit their need of database as VirtualDatabase\\n2. DBAs create and bind TrafficStrategy with DatabaseEndpoint\\n3. SREs add labels `pisanix.io/inject=enabled` to the application and update the configuration with credentials stored in VirtualDatabase.\\n\\nAfter the application is running, we can checkout the Socks-shop website as below:\\n\\n![](/img/socks-shop.png)\\n\\n## How about the next steps ?\\nAs we can see that Pisanix is very young, and have a definitely long way to run. In the next, we will first enhance the ability of traffic governance, like adding data sharding, data access behavior auditing, runtime resource Qos, etc. And we also continuously improving the performance and operability of Pisanix. More extensions mechanism like plugins will be in the future, help users to build their own solution very easily.\\n\\n## Community Call\\n\\nBuilding an open source community needs help from everywhere, no matter it\'s code or documentation, issues or pull requests, community thanks all of your efforts.\\n\\nAt present, there are some ways to join the community:\\n\\n| | |\\n|:-|:-|\\n| Mailing List| https://groups.google.com/g/database-mesh |\\n| Dev Meetings (Starting Feb 27th, 2022), Bi-weekly Wednesday 9:00AM PST|https://meet.google.com/yhv-zrby-pyt |\\n| Dev Meetings APAC Friendly (Starting April 27th, 2022), Bi-weekly APAC Wednesday 9:00PM GMT+8|https://meeting.tencent.com/dm/6UXDMNsHBVQO |\\n| Wechat Broker|pisanix|\\n| Slack |https://join.slack.com/t/databasemesh/shared_invite/zt-19rhvnxkz-USjZ~am~ghd_Q0q~8bAJXA  |\\n| Meetings Notes |https://bit.ly/39Fqt3x |\\n\\nFeel free to talk !"}]}')}}]);
